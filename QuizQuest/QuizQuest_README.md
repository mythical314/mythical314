QuizQuest

This project was my first fully realized, end-to-end web application. Its use cases include the following:

- Create account
- Create custom multiple-choice quizzes
- Invite friends
- Challenge friends
- Online quiz battle
- View quiz statistics

The stack used is as follows:

-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
-Backend: Python
-Database: SQLite

In order to run this web app locally, you can simply download it and run app.py. An instance of the database will be created automatically.

I had lots of fun making this project and challenging my friends to quizzes. I'm proud to show the results of my work here- please let me know if you have f+eedback!
