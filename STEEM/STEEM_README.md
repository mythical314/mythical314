STEEM Game Library

This project is a end-to-end web application meant to demonstrate the functionality of advanced SQL queries alongside a flexible React-based frontend framework.  Its use cases include the following:

- Create account (user or developer)
- Invite friends
- View recommended friends
- Buy games (mockup)
- Publish games (mockup)
- View game statistics/achievements
- Post on forums
- Post reviews
- View friend's accounts and stats

The stack used is as follows:

- Frontend: HTML, React
- Backend: Python
- Database: SQLite

Requires Python3, SQLite3, and React/NodeJS to run.

In order to run this web app locally, you can simply download it, run one of the sql scripts (one creates an empty database, one populates it with test data) and run app.py. An instance of the database will be created automatically.

The app also works when hosted on a Vercel server.

I had lots of fun making this project and challenging my friends to quizzes. I'm proud to show the results of my work here- please let me know if you have f+eedback!
